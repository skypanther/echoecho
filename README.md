# echoecho

Simple node.js echo server and client

## Instructions

Install with:

```
[sudo] npm install git+https://git@github.com/skypanther/echoecho.git
```

### Echo server

Run as a standalone echo server:
```
Usage: ~/node_modules/echoecho/echoserver [-p port_number] [-v]
  Type `q` [Enter] to exit

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number
    -p, --port [portnumber]  Specify port on which to listen [54321]
    -v, --verbose            Log data received to the console
```

Or, require as a module:
```
var Echoserver = require('echoserver');
echoecho = new Echoserver([port], [verbose]);

```

### Echo client

Note, the echo server must be running _first_. Then, run as a standalone echo client:
```
Usage: ~/node_modules/echoecho/echoclient.js [-p port_number] [-H ip_address]

  Options:

    -h, --help               output usage information
    -V, --version            output the version number
    -p, --port [portnumber]  Specify port on which to send [54321]
    -H, --host [ip_address]  Specify IP address of the server [54321]
```

Or, require as a module:
```
var Echoclient = require('echoclient');
echoclient = new Echoclient();
echoclient.write('string'); // is echoed back by the server
echoclient.on('data', function(data) {
    console.log(data.toString());
});
```

## Unit tests

Included are simple tests for the server and client intended to be used with jasmine-node (other Jasmine packages might work). The following should test the server and client, respectively. Note, the server doesn't quit when the test is complete. Press Ctrl-C to close it.

```
jasmine-node ~/node_modules/echoecho/spec/echoserverSpec.js
jasmine-node ~/node_modules/echoecho/spec/echoclientSpec.js
```
